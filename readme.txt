Block Bad Queries (BBQ) helps protect WordPress against malicious URL requests. 

== Description ==

[Block Bad Queries (BBQ)](http://perishablepress.com/block-bad-queries/) is a simple script that protects your website against malicious URL requests. BBQ checks all incoming traffic and quietly blocks bad requests containing nasty stuff like eval(, base64_, and excessively long request-strings. This is a simple yet solid solution that works great for sites where .htaccess is not available. The BBQ script is available as a plugin for WordPress or standalone script for any PHP-powered website.

**Features include**

* Plug-n-play functionality
* No configuration required
* Born of simplicity, no frills
* Blocks a wide range of malicious requests
* Based on the [5G/6G Blacklist](http://perishablepress.com/6g-beta/)
* Scans all incoming traffic and blocks bad requests
* Works silently behind the scenes to protect your site

== Installation ==

To protect your site using this lightweight plugin, unzip and upload the "/block-bad-queries/" folder and contents to your plugin directory and activate via the WP Admin. No configuration necessary. Upload, activate and done. BBQ blocks bad queries automically to protect your site against malicious URL requests. Once active, this plugin will silently and effectively close any connections for these sorts of injection-type attacks.

== Upgrade Notice ==
