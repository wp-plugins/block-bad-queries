Description: Protect WordPress Against Malicious URL Requests 

Many WordPress sites gets attacked with extremely malicious code, fortunately Jeff Starr wrote a simple script that checks for excessively long request strings (i.e., greater than 255 characters), as well as the presence of either eval( or base64 in the request URI.

== Installation ==

To protect your site using this lightweight script, simply unzip the zip file, it only has one folder with three files inside it.  Now, upload that folder and it's contents to your WP plugin directory. 

Then to activate it, log into your WordPress Admin area and go to the installed plugins page, look for "Block Bad Queries" and click on Activate. That's it! 

Once active, this plugin will silently and effectively close any connections for these sorts of injection-type attacks.
