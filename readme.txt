== Description ==

Description: Protect WordPress Against Malicious URL Requests 

Block Bad Queries (BBQ) checks for excessively long request strings (i.e., greater than 255 characters), as well as the presence of either "eval(" or "base64" in the request URI. These sorts of nefarious requests were implicated in the September 2009 WordPress attacks.

== Installation ==

To protect your site using this lightweight plugin, unzip and upload the "block-bad-queries" folder and contents to your plugin directory and activate via the WP Admin.

Once active, this plugin will silently and effectively close any connections for these sorts of injection-type attacks.

== Upgrade Notice ==

To upgrade BBQ, remove old version and replace with new version. Nothing else needs done.

== Screenshots ==

No screenshots available - code only.

== Changelog ==

2011/02/21 - Updated readme.txt file
2009/12/30 - Additional request strings added
2009/12/30 - Added check for admin users

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: Do I need to do anything else for BBQ to work?
A: Nope, just install and relax knowing that BBQ is protecting your site from bad URL requests.
